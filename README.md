Abstract - A chatbot is a computer software program that conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods. This software is used to perform tasks such as quickly responding to users, informing them, helping to purchase products and providing better service to customers. Chatbots are programs that work on Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Machine Learning Platform. Chatbot has become more popular in business groups right now as it can reduce customer service costs and handles multiple users at a time. But yet to accomplish many tasks there is a need to make chatbots as efficient as possible. In this project, we provide the design of a chatbot, which provides a genuine and accurate answer for any query using Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) with python platform1.
